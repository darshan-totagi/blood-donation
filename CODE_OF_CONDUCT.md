## 🤝 Code of Conduct and Community Expectations

We anticipate that all participants will follow the following community standards in all project spaces in order to create a friendly and open atmosphere:

### 1. Be Respectful & Polite

No matter who you are, what your background is, or what your opinion is, we are dedicated to making sure that no one is harassed. Please be **kind, understanding, and professional** to all contributors, maintainers, and community members. Keep in mind that disagreements should always be constructive and focus on code or technical ideas, not on people.

### 2. Help Beginners & Newcomers

We ask that experienced members **warmly welcome new contributors**. Give clear, patient instructions and take the time to answer questions. We were all new at one point, and a helpful community is the best way to grow the project and make it easy for people to help. Always think that people mean well.

### 3. No spam or harassment

Always keep the workplace professional and open to everyone.  This makes it against the rules to do any kind of **harassment, discrimination, personal attacks, insults, or unwanted sexual attention**.  Also, don't use project communication channels to post spam, irrelevant, or too much promotional content.

### 4. Enforcement and Consequences

We are serious about our community standards.  The project maintainers will look into any violations of this Code of Conduct.  Depending on how bad the offence is, the consequences could be a **warning, a temporary ban, or permanent removal** from the project's repositories and discussion groups.
